# Smart-Glasses-for-Visually-Impaired-Person
The two primary features of our glasses are  distance detection and object recognition. They can identify  target items input by the user and can detect objects in their  line of sight.

This project was completed as team of 3 under the guidance Prof. Tang at UCI department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
